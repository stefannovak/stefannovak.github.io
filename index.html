    <h4><b>About Me</b></h4>
    <p>I began my programming journey in 2014, where I created a very simple website using HTML and CSS, following tutorials from TeamTreehouse. At this point I thought I might want to be a web developer, so I began to study some JavaScript. A year later, I discovered the world of game programming through Unity 3D which uses C#. I loved this, but the tutorials were lacking and at the time, I hadn't quite committed to programming just yet. After leaving a dead end job a year after, I returned to programming with the ambition of being a game developer, so I began to study C++, however I was quickly overwhelmed with the difficulty of having C++ as my first real programming language, so I switch to Java.
    </p>

    <p>
	From 2018, I took my time with Java and it begins to be the language where I really commit to becoming a developer. I enrolled in a Computing and IT degree at the Open University to broaden my knowledge and increase my employability prospects in the future. University was always a tough choice for me, I was the highest achiever in my year group yet I had no idea if I even wanted to go to univerity. I realise now that this was because of the lack of options given to me back in school. I originally got an offer in 2014 to study Economics at the University of Manchester, but I turned it down after quickly realising it wasn't what I wanted to do in my life. I then thought of returning to school for one more year to finish my Physics A level and get a degree in Physics instead, but I was also conflicted about this, so I decided to leave school. Looking back now, I don't regret the choice of not going to university, I only regret not realising computer programming was my true calling sooner.
	</p>

	<p>
	In 2019, I got serious, and commited full time to studying Java and taking it to a professional level. I developed my first application in March using the Swing framework, created my second using the Hibernate ORM in April, and am now working on learning Spring while trying to secure my first job as a Software Engineer. After receiving a code test from an employer interested in me, I realised that I really needed to brush up on my core Java skills, so I spent May learning from scratch once more, and most importantly, learning about data structures and algorithms. I'm now trying to consolidate this new knowledge into a project.
	</p>

	<p>I redesigned my website in June using the w3.css templates. I was proud of my original website, but I was never quite satisfied with it. I decided to use these quick, simple templates by w3 after discovering them when creating my Spring application, as they're just a lot quicker to create, more reliable and look far better. I would rather spend time becoming a better Java developer than maintaining and debugging a website.</p>

    <!-- Personal -->
    <h4>Who I am</h4>
	<img src="./images/personal/NY.jpg" alt="NYC" style="width:100%">
	<p>I am a jack of all trades. I love to spend hours on the computer, working and chilling out playing games (Dota 2!). However I have a deep love for the outdoors, bushcraft, fishing, it's my biggest dream to go tornado chasing one day! I enjoy complex calculus problems, I'm enrolled in a free Nuclear Energy course, but I love spending time in the workshop creating things such as the arcade machine I built myself earlier this year. I'm a dedicated full-time amatuer chef, cooking new things all the time, check it out on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stefananovak" target="_blank">Instagram!</a> The picture above is my on top of the Rockefeller skyscraper in NYC, my lifelong goal is to travel to every state in the USA, just 48 left to go!</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
	I am a personable, friendly presence in any team. Spending 2 years in retail taught me so much about customer service, but I didn't need the job to teach me how to treat people with respect and politeness. My greatest strength is my ability to learn things quickly, and my strong logical mind makes me a great asset to any company. Please don't hesistate to get in contact with me if you want to see if I would make a good fit for your business!
